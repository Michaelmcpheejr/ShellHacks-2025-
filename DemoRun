Hackathon Demo Script
Problem (20s):
PCI DSS gaps often cause breaches. GRC pros need real-time checks.

Show Dashboard (60s):
Badge, KPIs, and findings.

Export Report (20s):
One-click Markdown report.

Flip-to-Green (60s):
Start red (Non-Compliant)
Fix storage (UNENCRYPTED → ENCRYPTED) → yellow
Fix auth/transactions → green (Compliant)

Wrap (20s):
FraudDetector is a weekend-built, extensible PCI audit tool.
Next steps: live log ingestion, anomaly detection, fraud pattern checks.

Future Work
Real-time log ingestion
Fraud pattern detection (e.g., impossible travel, velocity anomalies)
SIEM integration (Splunk, Sentinel)
Multi-framework support (HIPAA, SOX, ISO 27001)
